# Multi-Agent Influence Diagrams (MAIDs) Code

**Last Updated:** November 11, 2024

## Overview

This is work-in-progress code, exploring connections between the MAIDs (Multi-Agent Influence Diagram) framework, the cadCAD simulation engine, and related notions in game theory and causal inference. Currently all of the interesting work is in the `notebooks` folder. 

## Future Work

More will likely be added here, as the work both expands and coalesces in terms of available information.
